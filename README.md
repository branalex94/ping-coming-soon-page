## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Submit their email address using an `input` field
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say _"Whoops! It looks like you forgot to add your email"_
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say _"Please provide a valid email address"_

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned a very simple way to handle the same input input error over different device sizes.

### Continued development

I'd like to keep focusing on form handling as well as better implementation of images for faster loading times.

### Useful resources

- [Email validation RegEx](https://www.w3resource.com/javascript/form/email-validation.php#:~:text=To%20get%20a%20valid%20email,%5D%2B)\*%24%2F.) - This helped me have a fast implementation of an email validation regular expression.
